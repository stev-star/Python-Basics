# Introduction To Python Programming

Python is a high-level,geneal-purpose,interpreted programming language which was created by Guido Van Rossum
and released in 1991.

It is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected and it supports multiple programming paradigms which include procedural,
object-oriented and fuctional programming.

## Why learn Python?

- it is beginner friendly-Python is a great language for the beginner-level programmers and supports the development
 of a wide range of applications.
- python is interpreted-Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter.
- python is object-oriented - Python supports Object-Oriented technique of programming that encapsulates code within objects.
- python is interactive - You can actually sit at a Python prompt and interact with the interpreter directly to write your programs.

## Characteristics of Python

- It can be easily integrated with other programming languages such as C,C++,Java e.t.c.
- It provides high-level-Python is a high-level programming language because programmers don’t need to 
  remember the system architecture, nor do they have to manage the memory.
- Object-Oriented - it focuses design around data and objects, rather than functions and logic.
- extensive standard library -  programmers don’t have to write their code for every single thing unlike
  other programming languages.
- Free and Open-Source - it is completely free to use, even for commercial purposes.

## Applications of Python

- Web Development
- Machine Learning and Artificial intelligence
- Data Science
- Audio and Visual Application
- Software Dvelopment
- Desktop GUI
- Web Scraping Application

## Python Hello World

### Here's how to create a python program that displays "Hello World!"
```python
print("Hello World!")
```

The print() is a built-in function that displays a message on the screen

## Python Identation

Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.

Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python
is very important.

Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.

 ```python
 for i in range(5):
   print(i)
 ```
    
    
## Comments

Comments start with a #, and Python will render the rest of the line as a comment

#This is a programm to display "Hello World!"
```python
print("Hello World!")
```
